# Greek in Tech
A project that demonstrates many greek words and names that we constantly use on modern computing and software engineering. You can view the site on [greekintech.com](http://greekintech.com/).

## Getting Started
You need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. When you are ready you can install all dependencies by typing :

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

After installation you only need to start the server using the last command.

## Contributing
All entries are available through the `npm` package [greek-in-tech](https://github.com/tsevdos/greek-in-tech/blob/master/data/entries.json). You can contribute entries with a pull request on this [repo](https://github.com/tsevdos/greek-in-tech/). If you don't want to mess with a pull request you can suggest an entry by [creating an issue](https://github.com/tsevdos/greek-in-tech/issues) or using the official [gitter chat](https://gitter.im/tsevdos/greek-in-tech). If you still find it hard, you can drop me an email (see my profile).

## Run tests
The test suite contains unit and functional tests. Make sure you have installed **phantomjs** and **casperjs** globally `npm install -g phantomjs && npm install -g casperjs` (and of course all the other dependencies with `npm install`). Then you can run all tests with :

```
npm test
```

You can also run only the **unit tests** (`npm run test-unit`) or the **functional tests** (`npm run test-functional`).

## Build / Compile source code (ES6 and SCSS)
Please don't edit directly the `main.css` file (located into `css` directory). This file is autogenerated from the `main.scss` (located into `scss` directory). Also the all JS (ES6) source code (located into `js` directory) is compiled and bundled using webpack into the `dist` directory. To build everything (SCSS and JS), make sure that you have all the dependencies installed (`npm install`) and just run the below command:

```
npm run build
```
